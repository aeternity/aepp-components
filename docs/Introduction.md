The aeternity aepp components are meant to provide aepp developers with reusable [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) components that adhere to our [styleguide](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-prototypes). Until the javascript comes bundled please use a build process such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [browserify](http://browserify.org/), [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), etc.
